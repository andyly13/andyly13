### What's up! I'm Andrew and I am a 2nd-year BIM Major @ UC Irvine.     

I  love learning about all things *tech* and am looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge in any way I can!

I am currently working on a **personal website** and an [**X (formerly Twitter) account**](https://twitter.com/andeezsports) where I keep my followers updated on interesting analytical trends in sports!

#### Let's get in touch! Find me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-ly-770771208) or send me an [email](mailto::lyandrew2004@gmail.com) and I'll be sure to respond!
