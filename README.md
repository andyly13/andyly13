### What's up! My name is Andrew and I am a 2nd-year BIM Major @ UC Irvine.     

I  love learning about all things *tech* and am looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge in any way I can!


Right now, I am an undergraduate research aide at UCI where I leverage NLP + various ML Libraries to extract relevant contract clause data. My largest impact has come from automating many tasks for my team of 
10+ individuals, copying and moving more than 2000 relevant files and creating, reading, and updating more than 30 directories in Google Drive for my team to use. Please check out my clause-extraction repo to see my work!

As for my personal projects, I am currently working on a [**personal website**](https://andyly13.github.io/) and an app named **Vital** where guardians are able to monitor their loved ones health remotely and communicate with them as well! The Vital App's Repo is currently private, but feel free to check out our 1st place finishing presentation featured at the top of my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-ly-770771208)!


#### Let's get in touch! Find me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-ly-770771208) or send me an [email](mailto::lyandrew2004@gmail.com) and I'll be sure to respond!
